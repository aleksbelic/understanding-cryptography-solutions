# 1.3 - Solution

### 1.

- _AES_ 128-bit:\
  128b key space = 2<sup>128</sup> possible keys
- _ASIC_ cracking speed:\
   5 x 10<sup>8</sup> keys/s = 500,000,000 keys/sec
- budget = $1,000,000
- _ASIC_ + costs = $50 x 2 = $100\
  _ASIC_ count: $1,000,000 / $100 = 10,000 working units
- cracking speed of 10,000 _ASIC_ units:\
  10,000 units x 500,000,000 keys/s = 5,000,000,000,000 keys/s = 5 x 10<sup>12</sup> keys/sec
- on average, an exhaustive key search finds the correct key after searching half the key space (2<sup>127</sup>):\
  2<sup>127</sup> possible keys / 5 x 10<sup>12</sup> keys/sec ~ 34 x 10<sup>24</sup> sec = 1,079 x 10<sup>15</sup> years
- Relative to the age of the Universe:\
  1,079 x 10<sup>15</sup> years / 10<sup>10</sup> years = **107,900,000** times the age of the Universe

### 2.

- 24h = 86,400 sec
- on average, an exhaustive key search finds the correct key after searching half the key space (2<sup>127</sup>). In order to find the key within 24 hours we need to try out:\
2<sup>127</sup> possible keys / 86,400 sec ~ 1.969 x 10<sup>33</sup> keys/sec
- so the ratio between the required future capability and todayâ€™s is:\
1.969 x 10<sup>33</sup> keys/sec / 5 x 10<sup>12</sup> keys/sec ~ 0.393 x 10<sup>21</sup>
- we want to find how many doublings (n) are needed to reach this performance:\
2<sup>x</sup> = 0.393 x 10<sup>21</sup>\
x ~ 68.37
- if each doubling takes 18 months (1.5 years), we need:\
68.37 x 1.5 years ~ **102.6 years**
