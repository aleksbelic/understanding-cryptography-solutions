We received the following ciphertext which was encoded with a shift cipher:

_xultpaajcxitltlxaarpjhtiwtgxktghidhipxciwtvgtpilpit
ghlxiwiwtxgqadds._

1. Perform an attack against the cipher based on a letter frequency count: How many letters do you have to identify through a frequency count to recover the key? What is the cleartext?

2. Who wrote this message?
