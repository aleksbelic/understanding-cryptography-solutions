## 1.5 - Problem

As we learned in this chapter, modular arithmetic is the basis of many crypto systems. As a consequence, we will address this topic with several problems in this and upcoming chapters.

Let’s start with an easy one: compute the result without a calculator.
1. 15 x 29 mod 13
2. 2 x 29 mod 13
3. 2 x 3 mod 13
4. −11 x 3 mod 13

The results should be given in the range from 0,1, . . . , modulus-1. Briefly describe
the relation between the different parts of the problem.
